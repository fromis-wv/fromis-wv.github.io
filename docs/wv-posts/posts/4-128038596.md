\#내_레시피를_알라<br> <br>YAKISOBA<br> <br>This is probably my favorite dishes for a light dinner, it's a simple dish yet so delicious! You can add whatever protein you like, such as chicken or pancetta, seafood also great too. But for this recipe I only use vegies since it is my favorite. Also you can use store-bought yakisoba sauce, but if you don't have it at home, I'm going to show the ingredients to make your own yakisoba sauce.<br> <br>Ingredients<br>- 100g-120g Yakisoba Noodles (you can substitute it with egg noodles or ramen)<br>- 20g White Onion<br>- 50g Green Cabbage<br>- 30g Bean Sprout<br>- 1 clove Garlic <br>- Salt &amp; Pepper<br>- Cooking Oil (for stir fry)<br>- Sesame Oil<br> <br>Sauce (you can adjust the amount to your liking)<br>- 1 Tbsp Worcesterhire Sauce (it is a must because it adds deep flavour!)<br>- 1 Tbsp Sugar<br>- 2 Tbsp Soy Sauce<br>- 1 Tbsp Oyster Sauce<br>- 1 Tbsp Ketchup<br> <br>Instructions<br>1. Combine all the yakisoba sauce ingredients in a bowl, and then set aside.<br>2. Remove the noodles from their package, rinse well and drain in a colander. If you need to boil it, you can boil it first but only until it is half cooked because we'll stir-fry it later.<br>3. Heat the cooking oil on a pan over medium-high heat. Add the sliced onion, and cook them for about 2-3 minutes until the onion softens. (Add the protein at this step if you want)<br>4. Add the chopped garlic, cabbage, and bean sprouts. Season it with salt and pepper, cook it for another minute.<br>4. Add the noodle and continue to stir-fry. As the noodles loosen, pour the sauce and stir to combine. <br>5. Lastly, swirl in the sesame oil before serving it on a plate.<br>
